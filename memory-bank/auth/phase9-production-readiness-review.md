* **Secrets:** Ensure `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` is strong, unique, and managed securely (not committed to Git). Ensure `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is managed securely.

<!-- STOP: Please review and approve before proceeding to the next step. -->

* **Session Management:** *Strongly consider* refactoring session creation/deletion logic using Connect Interceptors on the backend for better separation of concerns and robustness within the expense manager's backend architecture.
<!-- STOP: Please review and approve before proceeding to the next step. -->

* **CORS:** Double-check the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` setting in the backend `.env` for the production environment to ensure it matches the deployed frontend URL.
<!-- STOP: Please review and approve before proceeding to the next step. -->

* **Error Handling/Logging:** Enhance backend error handling and logging for production monitoring of the authentication and user management components.
<!-- STOP: Please review and approve before proceeding to the next step. -->

* **Security Headers/Rate Limiting:** Implement standard web security practices, such as appropriate security headers and rate limiting, for the authentication endpoints.
<!-- STOP: Please review and approve before proceeding to the next step. -->

* **Configuration Management:** Use environment variables or a proper configuration management system for all sensitive settings and configuration values in both the backend and frontend.
